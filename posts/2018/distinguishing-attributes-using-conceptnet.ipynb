    "\n",
    "As a kid, I used to hold marble racing tournaments in my room, rolling marbles simultaneously down plastic towers of tracks and funnels. I went so far as to set up a bracket of 64 marbles to find the fastest marble. I kind of thought that running marble tournaments was peculiar to me and my childhood, but now I've found out that marble racing videos on YouTube are a big thing! Some of them even have [overlays as if they're major sporting events](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7oZKioNQq-k).\n",
    "\n",
    "In the end, there's nothing special about the fastest marble compared to most other marbles. It's just lucky. If one ran the tournament again, the marble champion might lose in the first round. But the one thing you could conclude about the fastest marble is that it was no _worse_ than the other marbles. A bad marble (say, a misshapen one, or a plastic bead) would never luck out enough to win.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our paper, we tested 30 alternate versions of the classifier, including the one that was roughly equivalent to this very simple system. We were impressed by the fact that it performed as well as our real entry. And this could be because of the inherent power of ConceptNet Numberbatch, or it could be because it's the lucky marble.\n",
    "\n",
    "I tried it with other thresholds besides 0.1, and some of the nearby reasonable threshold values only score 71% or 72%. But that still tells you that this interestingly simple system is doing the right thing and is capable of getting a very good result. It's good enough to be the lucky marble, so it's good enough for this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "Incidentally, the same argument about \"lucky systems\" applies to SemEval entries themselves. There are dozens of entries from different teams, and the top-scoring entry is going to be an entry that did the right thing and also got lucky.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the post-SemEval discussion at ACL, someone proposed that all results should be Bayesian probability distributions, estimated by evaluating systems on various subsets of the test data, and instead of declaring a single winner or a tie, we should get probabilistic beliefs as results: \"There is an 80% chance that entry A is the best solution to the task, an 18% chance that entry B is the best solution...\"\n",
